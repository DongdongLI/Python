This file provides simple function to find any files according to a given pattern.
====================================================================================
After running it at the command line, there will be the first question: where would you like to start?
  You can easy type in: /   or    /Users/lee/Documents
  
After that ,there will be the second one: what would you like to find?
 Here, I need you to type in the pattern based on the table below:

 * 	matches everything
? 	matches any single character
[seq] 	matches any character in seq
[!seq] 	matches any character not in seq

For example, if you want to find all the python source files, type in: *.py
If you want to find something contains 'abc' in their filenames, you might want to type in: *abc*.*
